# Password Policy Guide

## 🔐 AWS Cognito Password Requirements

Your BookNest application now enforces AWS Cognito's password policy. All passwords must contain:

### ✅ **Required Characters:**

- **Minimum Length**: 8 characters

- **Uppercase**: A-Z (at least one)
- **Numbers**: 0-9 (at least one)
- **Special Characters**: !@#$%^&\*()\_+-=[]{}|;:,.<>? (at least one)

### ❌ **Your Password Issue:**

The password `S3965528!` failed because:

- ✅ Has 9 characters (meets minimum)
- ✅ Has uppercase letters (S)
- ❌ **Missing lowercase letters** ← This caused the error
- ✅ Has numbers (3965528)
- ✅ Has special characters (!)

### ✅ **Fixed Examples:**

- `Secure123!` ← Complete password

1. **Real-time Validation**: Password requirements show as you type
2. **Visual Indicators**: Green checkmarks for met requirements
3. **Better Error Messages**: Clear explanation of policy violations
4. **Submit Prevention**: Button disabled until all requirements met
